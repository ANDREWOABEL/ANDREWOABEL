  <b>TO-DO: Update Bio!</b>
  My main research interest is in large-scale Machine Learning. 
  I am passionate about developing models that address the challenges posed by the data today â€” high volume, velocity, and variety. 
  I am also interested in mining and modeling social and information networks, and natural language processing. 
  My previous work focuses on: recommender systems, semi-supervised learning, active learning, sentiment analysis, building Wordnets.

  I spent the summer of 2014 doing an internship in the Amazon Machine Learning team in Berlin working on scalable algorithms for learning sparse models.
